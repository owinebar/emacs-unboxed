1 Overview
**********

The unboxed package manager extends the built-in package manager by
managing the files provided by the package individually.  This enables
package-provided files of a particular type to be installed in a common
location, rather than a package-specific location.  In this way, the
"path" variables of emacs, e.g.  load-path, custom-theme-load-path, etc,
only contain one additional directory for all installed packages rather
than one directory per installed package.  This is the feature that
makes unboxed package management scalable.  With the default package
management system, having a hundred packages installed can have a
noticeable impact on system performance simply due to the number of
directories that require searching before a system package is found in
the last entry on the list.  With unboxed package management, thousands
of packages may be installed without any noticeable impact on system
performance.

   The unboxed package manager also enhances the builtin package
management by providing a list of "unboxing areas" for package
management with nested scoping.  The default configuration defines two
areas: site and user.  The site unboxing area allows a site
administrator to install packages in a system location for common use.
The user unboxing area is for packages installed by individual users.
The scoping rule means that site packages are only allowed to depend on
other site packages or builtin packages.  The user area has the site
area in scope, so user packages may depend on builtin, site, or other
user packages.  Unboxing areas are defined by user customization
variables.

   The unboxed package manager does not require any modification of
files or directories created by the builtin package manager.  Packages
may be switched between the builtin and the unboxed package managers
freely, at least for packages that are "unbox-able".
